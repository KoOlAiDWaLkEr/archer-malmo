				My experience at Archer Malmo was fantastic. We went to Downtown Memphis and got out of school just to go and visit a web design company. The way the company operates was actually a lot more meticulous. There is a whole structure to all the elements to design all the way to client to company communication. The company also works on many projects at the same time. Archer Malmo is also considered an agency compared to a corporate company which gives the company a much more vibrant and family feel.

				Another awesome part of the trip, yes I know a little off topic was when we went to cookout after. It was fun going around downtown and really getting to know the people in the classes I take. Though, all of us are very different, I think we all take Web Design for similar reasons. That is intriguing to me, and even better we are all there because we want to be there.

				The building complex itself was pretty cool. It was an old cotton place. Essentially what they did was determine if cotton from farms was suitable enough for consumer use. They also owned like 90% of the building, or at least have employees on those floors. It was pretty cool walking through each building and you could really tell that each floor and the people that were in it had a story. The Graphic Designer and coding floor was definitely the most vibrant. It looked as if everyone in there loved what there were doing and they expressed it by the way the whole floor was laid out and designed.

				On the trip we met some pretty cool people. Ben, will, other dude, VP dude. They told us their stories and how they ended up at Archer Malmo. The atmosphere between all of them felt like they really did enjoying working together. With all their backgrounds they all had something to bring to the table and contribute.
